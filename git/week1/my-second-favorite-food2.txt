Make the Most Delicious Chicken Caprese


Make sure your skillet is hot before adding the chicken. This will give the chicken a nice golden-brown sear. The olive oil shimmers when it’s hot. If it’s smoking, pull the skillet away from the heat. That means it’s too hot! 
Don’t move your chicken around the skillet while it cooks—it will prevent them from getting a golden-brown sear and it will take longer to cook.
The size and thickness of the chicken breasts dictates how long it will take to cook them through. Use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness. You’re looking for 165°F.
Use cooking-grade balsamic vinegar, not the fancy type. Traditional balsamic vinegars— labeled as “tradizionale” or “DOP”—aren’t meant for cooking with heat. They are thicker, sweeter, generally more expensive, and best used for drizzling on top only right before serving. For this recipe, look for balsamic labeled as “of Modena.” It’s more affordable and more versatile—use it for cooking or as a finishing drizzle. Always double check the label on the bottle for suggestions.
